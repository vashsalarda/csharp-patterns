# Design Patterns In C#

**Creational patterns** - provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Structural patterns** - explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**Behavioral patterns** - take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    
### Creational Design Pattern:
- **Abstract Factory** - Creates an instance of several families of classes
- **Builder**	- Separates object construction from its representation
- **Factory Method** - Creates an instance of several derived classes
- **Prototype**	- A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- **Singleton**	- A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural Design Patterns:
- **Adapter**	- Match interfaces of different classes
- **Bridge** - Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
- **Composite**	- A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- **Decorator**	- Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **Facade** - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- **Flyweight**	- A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- **Proxy**	- An object representing another object

### Behavioral Design Patterns:
- **Chain of Responsibility** - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- **Command** - Encapsulate a command request as an object
- **Interpreter**	- A way to include language elements in a program
- **Iterator** - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- **Mediator** - Defines simplified communication between classes
- **Memento**	- Capture and restore an object's internal state
- **Observer** - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- **State**	- Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- **Strategy** - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- **Template Method**	- Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- **Visitor**	- Defines a new operation to a class without change
